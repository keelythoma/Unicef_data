## Introduction

Youth well-being is a cornerstone of future development, yet many young people around the world face challenges to health and safety — particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. In this report, we explore global patterns in youth mortality and urbanization using data from UNICEF.

We ask:  
- How does youth mortality differ by country and gender?
- What trends exist over time?
- Is there a link between youth mortality and development indicators like GDP or life expectancy?
- How does rapid urban growth play into this?

We'll answer these questions through data visualizations and analysis.

## Data Overview

```{python}
#| label: data-import
#| message: false

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from plotnine import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import geopandas as gpd
import geodatasets

# Import data
indicator1 = pd.read_csv("data/unicef_indicator_1.csv")
indicator2 = pd.read_csv("data/unicef_indicator_2.csv")
metadata = pd.read_csv("data/unicef_metadata.csv")

# print("indicator1 columns:", indicator1.columns.tolist())
# print("indicator2 columns:", indicator2.columns.tolist())
# print("metadata columns:", metadata.columns.tolist())

# Display first few rows of each dataset
print("Indicator 1 Preview:")
display(indicator1.head())

print("\nIndicator 2 Preview:")
display(indicator2.head())

print("\nMetadata Preview:")
display(metadata.head())

# Basic information about the datasets
print("\nIndicator 1 Shape:", indicator1.shape)
print("Indicator 2 Shape:", indicator2.shape)
print("Metadata Shape:", metadata.shape)
```

## Data Preparation and Technology overview

For this project, I used Python as the primary tool for data preparation, analysis, and visualization. Libraries like Pandas helped me efficiently clean and manipulate the data, while Plotnine was used to create elegant, grammar-of-graphics-style visualizations. I wrote and rendered the final report using Quarto, which allowed me to combine code, visualizations, and narrative in a clean, reproducible format. The entire workflow was developed in Visual Studio Code, with a virtual environment set up to manage dependencies and ensure consistency.

The data itself came from UNICEF, including a metadata file containing country-level details and several indicator files tracking various metrics over time—such as youth mortality, GDP per capita, and related social indicators. My goal was to investigate how socioeconomic factors like income might relate to youth deaths (ages 15–24) across countries from 1990 to 2021. I began by inspecting and cleaning each dataset, merging them where necessary using ISO country codes, and filtering them down to the relevant indicators. Once the data was structured properly, I used visual tools like scatter plots and linear trend lines to explore potential correlations, often applying log transformations to account for skewed distributions.

```{python}
#| label: data-preparation

# Clean and rename columns
urban_growth_clean = indicator1[["country", "alpha_3_code", "obs_value"]].rename(
    columns={"obs_value": "urban_growth_rate"}
)

youth_deaths_total = indicator2[indicator2["sex"] == "Total"]
youth_deaths_yearly = youth_deaths_total.groupby(["country", "time_period"])["obs_value"].sum().reset_index()
youth_deaths_yearly.rename(columns={"obs_value": "total_deaths", "time_period": "year"}, inplace=True)

# Prepare metadata for merging
metadata_clean = metadata.rename(columns={"year": "year"})

# Combine data for scatterplot
combined_data = pd.merge(
    youth_deaths_yearly,
    metadata_clean,
    on=["country", "year"],
    how="inner"
).dropna(subset=["GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)", "Life expectancy at birth, total (years)"])
```

## Key Findings

- Urban population growth is concentrated in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
- Youth mortality remains highest in low-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
- There is a clear **negative correlation between GDP per capita and youth deaths** — wealthier nations have fewer deaths.
- While global youth deaths have generally declined since 1990, progress has not been uniform.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Rapid urbanization, if not well-managed, may place stress on healthcare systems and contribute to poor youth outcomes. Countries with low GDP and limited health infrastructure report the highest youth mortality.

To reduce youth deaths, governments should invest in:
- Health education and outreach
- Adolescent health services
- Urban planning and safety programs

Further research should examine regional policies and infrastructure in more detail to explain the observed differences.
