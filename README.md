# UNICEF Data Analysis Project
# Youth Mortality and Economic Indicators (1990–2021)

This project explores the relationship between youth mortality (ages 15–24) and economic indicators such as GDP per capita from 1990 to 2021, using data sourced from UNICEF and the World Bank. The analysis is presented using Python, Quarto, and several powerful data science libraries.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to understand how youth death rates vary across countries and over time, and whether economic development correlates with reductions in youth mortality.

Four visualizations are used to illustrate different dimensions of this relationship, covering trends over time, geographic distribution, and correlations with economic metrics.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Plotnine, Matplotlib)
- **Quarto** for report rendering
- **VS Code** as the development environment
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
- **Jupyter-style notebooks** embedded in `.qmd` for literate programming

## 🗂️ Data Sources

- **UNICEF Mortality Data**: Youth mortality figures by country and year
- **World Bank Metadata**: Includes GDP per capita and country-level metadata

## 📈 Visualizations

1. **Total Youth Deaths by Country (2021)**  
   A bar chart showing the highest youth mortality totals by country in the most recent year.

2. **Trend of Youth Deaths Over Time**  
   A line graph showing how youth deaths have changed globally or by region between 1990 and 2021.

3. **Scatterplot: GDP vs Youth Deaths**  
   A scatterplot (with regression line) analyzing the relationship between GDP per capita and total youth deaths. GDP is plotted on a log scale.

4. **Choropleth Map of Death Rates**  
   A map visualization (if included) displaying mortality rates geographically to highlight regional disparities.
